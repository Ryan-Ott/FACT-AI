# FACT-AI 2024

## Steps for running the results notebook

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-Ott/FACT-AI.git
   ```

3. Download and extract the zip files shared through the Google Drive link

   - You should find the following three archive files: `datasets.zip`, `checkpoints.zip`, `weights.zip`
   - You should extract all files under the root directory of the cloned repo
   - Note: sometimes it can happen that the contents of the zip files from GitHub get corrupted. If you experience this problem, please let us know and we'll figure out a way to send you the the appropriate files.

5. Open the `results.ipynb` notebook and you should be able to run all cells

   ```
   jupyter notebook results.ipynb
   ```
   - The notebook contains code to reproduce the quantitative and qualitative results from our paper. Furthermore, it reproduces the results from our extensions.
